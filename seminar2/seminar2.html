&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* Everyone must read the articles and solve the questions.

*  Some articles are highly technical so focus on the big picture.

## Question 1 ##

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Use the 'Weil Data' dataset on Moodle to make a scatter plot of average years in education (Column L) and GDP per worker (Column N, you should use a ratio/log scale) in 2009. What is the general relationship?

## Results ##

Barro, Robert J. 'Human capital and growth.' American economic review 91, no. 2 (2001): 12-17.

&amp;nbsp;

* Determinants of long-run economic growth

* Distinguishes between

 * quantity of education, measured by years of school attainment
 
 * quality of education, gauged by scores on internationally comparable examinations
 
* Quality of schooling is more important than the quantity

---
## Methodoloy ##

&amp;nbsp;


* Roughly 100 countries

* The growth rate is measured over three ten-year periods: 1965--1975, 1975--1985, and 1985--1995

* Three-stages least squares estimation with instruments
 * actual values of schooling, openness, and terms-of-trade variables
 
 * lagged values of other variables

## Results ##

&amp;nbsp;


* The level of GDP:

 * Significantly positive for log(GDP) and negative for the square of log(GDP)
 
 * Marginal effect for US in 1995 ($18,915 in 1985 prices) is -.058.
 
 * 10% increase in GDP (US marginal effect) `\(\Rightarrow\)` 0.6% decrease in growth rate

### Relationship Between GDP growth rate and initial GDP ###

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="https://gunerilhan.github.io/img/seminar2/figure1.pdf" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
---

###  Government consumption / GDP ###

* Exclusively of spending on education and defense

* Do not directly enhance productivity

* Statistically significant negative impact on growth rate

*  10 percentage points increase in G/Y `\(\Rightarrow\)` reduce growth rate on impact by 1.6 percent per year

###  Rule of law ###

* Statistically significant and positive

* An improvement by one category (increase by 0.17) `\(\Rightarrow\)` increase growth on impact by 0.2%.


---
### Openness ###

* (Exports + Imports) / GDP
* Significantly positive effect
* Significantly negative effect when interacted with log(GDP)
* Impact of openness diminishes as a country gets richer

### Inflation rate ###

* Marginally significant, negative effect
* 10% percentage point increase in inflation reduces growth rate on impact by 0.14% per year.

---
###  Fertility rate ###

* Significant negative relationship

### Investment rate ###

* Marginally significant (?) and positive

### Terms of trade ###

* Export prices over import prices
* Improvements in terms of trade `\(\Rightarrow\)` economic growth

---

### Effects of Education 

* Given GDP, higher human capital implies higher 
human capital / physical capital

* Higher human / physical capital `\(\Rightarrow\)` growth by

 * Absorption of superior technologies
 * Adjusting upward the quantity of physical capital (since human capital is harder to adjust)

* Statistically significant and positive effect
* An additional year of schooling `\(\Rightarrow\)` growth rate goes up by 0.44% per year on impact

&lt;/center&gt;
---

### Effects of Education, cont'd ###

* Female attainment at the secondary and higher levels of education

 * Statistically insignificant
 * Under utilization of females in labor force
 
* Male primary schooling
 * Statistically insignificant
 * Prerequisite for secondary education
 * Affects through secondary education

* Female primary schooling

 * Statistically insignificant
 * If fertility is not held constant, it becomes significant (.0039 (SE=.0013))
 * `\(\Rightarrow\)` lower fertility `\(\Rightarrow\)` higher growth

### Quality of Schooling 

* Scores on international examinations matter more than years of attainment on economic growth (Hanusbek and Kimko (2000))

&lt;/center&gt;

---

### Quality of schooling, cont'd ###

* Science scores

 * Statistically significant and positive

 * One standard deviation increase in scores (by .08) `\(\Rightarrow\)` 1% percent increase in growth on impact

 * Male schooling is marginally significant (?)

* Both quality and quantity of education matters, but quality matters more

* Math scores are also statistically significant and positive

* Reading scores are insignificant (puzzling)

* Reading scores becomes positive and significant once we include all scores


---
### Test scores on growth rate ###

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="https://gunerilhan.github.io/img/seminar2/figure3.pdf" width="60%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
### Question 4

&amp;nbsp;

What are the policy implications of Barro (2001)?

* Should the government invest more in secondary and higher education?

* Should the government fund/promote science subjects above others?

* Should there be a labor market policy that utilizes highly educated females?
